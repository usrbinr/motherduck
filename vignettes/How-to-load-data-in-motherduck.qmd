## Introduction

Before we get into how to use the package, lets quickly review the three things you will need to load data into a database:

**Database name (Catalog Name)**

-   This is object that will hold your schemas, tables or views
-   Different databases have their own naming convention, in motherduck, this is called Catalog

**Schema name**

-   This is fancy name for the location that classifies and organizes your tables, functions, procedures, etc

**Table or view name**

-   This is the name of the actual table or view that holds your data
-   Table can be a physical table of data that persists whereas a view is a stored procedures that queries underlying tables when needed

To save or reference data, you need to either fully qualify the name with "database_name.schema_name.table_name" or you need to be "in" your database and schema and reference the table name.

If you uploaded data without creating a table or schema first then duckdb will assign "temp" and "main" as the default names for your database and schema respectively.

## Teminology: Duckdb vs. Motherduck

While not technically correct explanation; motherduck is a cloud based deployment of duckdb where you can have multiple databases, control access / permissions, and scale compute / storage as needed

Duckdb is a essentially a single database instance in your local computer where you can save the database to a file or create it in memory.

Through out these write ups, I tend to use duckdb & motherduck interchangeably however all functions will work motherduck database and most will still work with a duckdb database.

If you are using a local duckdb database you can leave the database argument blank.
:::

## Let's upload some data

Later on we will show examples of how to read data from a source file, eg. csv, parquet, or even excel directly into motherduck without loading the data into memory but for now let's assume you want to upload some data that you already have loaded in your R environment.

First let us connect to our motherduck database. In order to connect, you will need:

-   motherduck account
-   access token
-   motherduck extension for duckdb

The `connect_to_motherduck()` function will take your access token that is your environment file, install and load the extensions and then finally connect to your motherduck instance.

Use `usethis::edit_r_environ()` to save your access token to a variable name

::: {#cau-con .callout-caution collapse="true"}
## connect-to-motherduck

One limitation of the connecting to motherduck from R is that you first need to create a local motherduck instance which then allows the connection to motherduck.

This means you have access to both local (temporary) duckdb database and your cloud based motherduck databases.

Check which database you are "in" with the `pwd()` command
:::

```{r}
#| label: connect
#| echo: true
#| warning: true
#| message: true
#| include: true

con_md <- connect_to_motherduck(motherduck_token = "MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN") 
```

-  Pass your token name from your R environment file

You will get a message that prints out that actions the package took and information about your connection

Before uploading new data, it can be helpful to check "where" you are in your database

You can do this with the `pwd()` function that will print out the current database & schema that you are in.


This would be the default location that you save your database unless you clarified a different database and schema.

```{r}
#| label: pwd
#| echo: true
#| warning: true
#| message: true
#| include: true

pwd(con_md)
```

By default, you will be in your local duckdb database even though you are connected to motherduck

See @cau-con to understand why we start in a local database vs. motherduck

If we want to we can also navigate to your motherduck database with the `cd()` command

```{r}
#| label: cd
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: true
#| include: true

cd(con_md,database = "contoso")
```

I am now in motherduck based [contoso](https://usrbinr.github.io/contoso/) database and any reference to schema or table would be relative to this database.

Let's verify that by list the all the tables in this database. We can do that with the `list_all_tables()` function.

```{r}
#| label: list-all
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| include: true

list_all_tables(con_md)
```

```{r}
#| label: list-all-hidden
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| include: true


  list_all_tables(con_md) |> 
    gt::gt() |>
    gt::tab_options(
      ,ihtml.active = TRUE
      ,ihtml.use_pagination = TRUE
      ,ihtml.use_compact_mode = TRUE
      ,ihtml.page_size_default = 5
      )

```

Now that we knwo how to navigate to our various databaes, lets finally load data somee existing data into a new database and schema. `create_table()` function will create a new database / schema and save then load the data into a table.

```{r}
#| label: create-table
#| echo: true
#| warning: true
#| message: true
#| include: true

ggplot2::diamonds |>  
    create_table(
        .con = con_md 
        ,database_name = "vignette" 
        ,schema_name = "raw" 
        ,table_name = "diamonds" 
        ,write_type="overwrite"  
        )
```

-  Pass your data into the function
-  List your motherduck connection
-  database name (either new or existing)
-  schema name (either new or existing)
-  table name
-  Either overwrite or append the data

Notice that we don't assign this object to anything, this just silently writes our data to our database and prints a message confirming the performed actions as well as some summary of catalogs, schemas, tables and shares that you haves access

To validate the data is in our database, we can do the following:

We can validate if we have successfully saved the table in our database by running `list_all_tables()`.

If you want to access your motherduck data, you can simply leverage `dplyr::tbl()` or `DBI::dbGetQuery()` functions with your motherduck connection to pull your data.

## Organizing our data

Let's say we want to filter and summarize this table and save it to our database with a new table name -- no problem, we can repeat the steps and this time we will upload a DBI object instead of tibble.

```{r}
#| label: organize
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: true
#| include: true

id_name <- DBI::Id("vignette","raw","diamonds") 

diamonds_summary_tbl <- dplyr::tbl(con_md,id_name) |>  
    dplyr::summarise(
        .by=c(color,cut,clarity)
        ,mean_price=mean(price,na.rm=TRUE)
    )


diamonds_summary_tbl |> 
    create_table(   
    .con = con_md
    ,database_name = "vignette"
    ,schema_name = "raw"
    ,table_name = "diamonds_summary" 
    ,write_type = "overwrite"
)

```

-  You can directly call the full name or if you are already in your database / schema you can just call the table
-  Perform your additional cleaning, transformation, or summarization steps
-  Pass the DBI object to create_table and it will still save the table!

While its the same syntax, `create_table()` will work with an R object, duckplyr or DBI object to save that table into your database.

## Create new schema

Let's say we want to organize these existing tables into a different schema, we can do this by first creating a new schema and then moving that table or alternatively loading a table directly with a new schema and table.

```{r}
#| label: new-schema
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: true
#| include: true

    create_schema(
        .con=con_md
        ,database_name = "vignette"
        ,schema_name = "curated"
    )
```

This will create a new schema if it doesn't exist but won't load any data.

```{r}
#| label: list-schemas
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| include: true

list_current_schemas(con_md)

```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Default schemas

When you create a database it will have a default schema "main", so even though we only created "raw" and "curated" schemas we see three schemas due to the default (that you can't delete)
:::


We can copy one of a series of tables to our new schema with `copy_tables_to_new_location()`. This accepts a tibble or DBI object of objects with table_catalog, table_schema, table_name headers and will copy them into your new location.

```{r}
#| label: copy-table-to-location
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| warning: false
#| message: true
#| include: true



list_all_tables(con_md) |> 
  filter(
    table_catalog=="vignette"
  ) |> 
  copy_tables_to_new_location(
    .con = con_md
    ,from_table_names = _
    ,to_database_name = "vignette"
    ,to_schema_name = "curated"
    )
```

There's a complimentary function called `create_or_repalce_schema` which will also create a schema the different is if there is already a schema with that name it will delete that schema and any tables saved under it.

## Drop databaes, schemas or tables

Sometimes we need to delete databases, schemas or tables.

Be careful when you do this as its irreversible -- there is no CTRL+Z to undo this.

```{r}
#| label: delete-schema
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: true
#| include: true

delete_schema(con_md,database_name = "vignette",schema_name = "curated",cascade = TRUE)
```

## How to load data directly into motherduck

For csv files we can leverage the existing duckdb function `duckdb::read_csv_duckdb()` to directly read the a csv file or a series of csv files into your duckdb or motherduck database

This will read the files from their source location directly into your database without loading the files into memory which is helpful when you are dealing with larger than memory data.

Underneath the hood the duckdb function is using the "read_csv_auto" and you can pass the configuration options directly through the the read_csv function if you need configuration.

```{r}
#| label: read-csv
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: true
#| include: true

write.csv(mtcars,"mtcars.csv")

# cd(schema = "raw")

read_csv(con = con_md,file_path =  "mtcars.csv",to_table_name = "mtcars",header = TRUE)


```

For or excel, parquet or httpfs file formats, we can leverage `read_excel()`.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function, this code leverage underlying duckdb extensions to read these different file formats.

You can view the default configuration tables with the `motherduck::config_csv` and `motherduck::config_excel` family of reference tables.

```{r}
#| label: delete-csv
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| include: true
fs::file_delete("mtcars.csv")
```

```{r}
#| label: read-xl
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| include: true
    
openxlsx::write.xlsx(dplyr::starwars,"starwars.xlsx") 


read_excel(
    .con=con_md 
    ,to_database_name = "vignette" 
    ,to_schema_name = "main" 
    ,to_table_name = "starwars" 
    ,file_path = "starwars.xlsx" 
    ,header = TRUE 
    ,sheet = "Sheet 1" 
    ,all_varchar  = TRUE 
    ,write_type = "overwrite"  
)


```

-  Create a excel file
-  Pass through our connection
-  Select the database we want the table to be saved in
-  Select the schema we want the table to be saved in
-  Select the table name
-  Select the filepath to the excel file
-  Clarify if we want the first line to be used as headers
-  Clarify the sheet name to read
-  Clarify if all columns types be read in as characters
-  Select if we should overwrite to an existing table or append

Below are the list of configuration options available to be passed through to respective read\_\* functions.

```{r}
#| label: delete-excel
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| include: false
fs::file_delete("starwars.xlsx")
```
